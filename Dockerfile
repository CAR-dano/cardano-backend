# Set the working directory inside the container. All subsequent commands will run from this directory.

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) to the working directory.
# This allows npm ci to install dependencies before copying the rest of the application code,
# leveraging Docker's layer caching for faster builds.

# Install project dependencies. `npm ci` is used for clean and consistent installations in CI/CD environments.
RUN npm ci

RUN npx prisma generate

# Build the application. This typically compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

# STAGE 2: Production Stage
# This stage creates a lean image for production, containing only the necessary runtime components.

# Use the same base image as the build stage for consistency.
